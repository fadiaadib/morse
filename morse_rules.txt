Each Morse code symbol is formed by a sequence of dits and dahs.
The dit duration can vary for signal clarity and operator skill, but for any one message,
once established it is the basic unit of time measurement in Morse code.
The duration of a dah is three times the duration of a dit (although some telegraphers
deliberately exaggerate the length of a dah for clearer signalling).
Each dit or dah within an encoded character is followed by a period of signal absence,
called a space, equal to the dit duration. The letters of a word are separated by a space o
f duration equal to three dits, and words are separated by a space equal to seven dits.
